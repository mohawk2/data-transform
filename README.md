# SYNOPSIS

    use JSON::Transform qw(parse_transform);
    use JSON::MaybeXS;
    my $transformer = parse_transform(from_file($transformfile));
    to_file($outputfile, encode_json $transformer->(decode_json $json_input));

# DESCRIPTION

Implements a language concisely describing a set of
transformations from an arbitrary JSON-able piece of data, to
another one. The description language uses [JSON Pointer (RFC
6901)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901) for addressing. JSON-able
means only strings, booleans, nulls (Perl `undef`), numbers, array-refs,
hash-refs, with no circular references.

A transformation is made up of an output expression, which can be composed
of sub-expressions.

For instance, to transform an array of hashes that each have an `id`
key, to a hash mapping each `id` to its hash:

    # [ { "id": 1, "name": "Alice" }, { "id": 2, "name": "Bob" } ]
    # ->
    "" <@ { "/$K/id":$V-`id` }
    # ->
    # { "1": { "name": "Alice" }, "2": { "name": "Bob" } }

While to do the reverse transformation:

    "" <% [ $V+`id`:$K ]

The identity for an array:

    "" <@ [ $V ]

The identity for an object/hash:

    "" <% { $K:$V }

To move from one part of a structure to another:

    "/destination" << "/source"

To copy from one part of a structure to another:

    "/destination" <- "/source"

To do the same with a transformation (assumes `/source` is an array
of hashes):

    "/destination" <- "/source" <@ [ $V+`order`:$K ]

To bind a variable, then replace the whole data structure:

    $defs <- "/definitions"
    "" <- $defs

## Expression types

- Object/hash

    These terms are used here interchangeably.

- Array
- String
- Integer
- Float
- Boolean
- Null

## JSON pointers

JSON pointers are surrounded by `""`. JSON pointer syntax gives special
meaning to the `~` character, as well as to `/`. To quote a `~`,
say `~0`. To quote a `/`, say `~1`. Since a `$` has special meaning,
to use a literal one, say `~2`.

The output type of a JSON pointer is whatever the pointed-at value is.

## Transformations

A transformation has a destination, a transformation type operator, and
a source-value expression. The destination can be a variable to bind to,
or a JSON pointer.

If the source-value expression has a JSON-pointer source, then the
destination can be omitted and the JSON-pointer source will be used.

The output type of the source-value expression can be anything.

### Transformation operators

- `<-`

    Copying (including assignment for variable bindings)

- `<<`

    Moving - error if the source-value is other than a bare JSON pointer

## Destination value expressions

These can be either a variable, or a JSON pointer.

### Variables

These are expressed as `$` followed by a lower-case letter, followed
by zero or more letters.

## Source value expressions

These can be either a single value including variables, of any type,
or a mapping expression.

## String value expressions

String value expressions can be surrounded by ``` `` ```. They have the same
quoting rules as in JSON's `"`-surrounded strings, including quoting
of `` ` `` using `\`. Any value inside, including variables, will be
concatenated in the obvious way, and numbers will be coerced into strings
(be careful of locale). Booleans and nulls will be stringified into
`[true]`, `[false]`, `[null]`.

## Mapping expressions

A mapping expression has a source-value, a mapping operator, and a
mapping description.

The mapping operator is either `<@`, requiring the source-value
to be of type array, or `<%`, requiring type object/hash. If the
input data pointed at by the source value expression is not the right
type, this is an error.

The mapping description must be surrounded by either `[]` meaning return
type array, or `{}` for object/hash.

The description will be evaluated once for each input value.
Within the brackets, `$K` and `$V` will have special meaning.

For an array input, each input will be each single array value, and `$K`
will be the zero-based array index.

For an object/hash input, each input will be each pair. `$K` will be
the object key being evaluated, of type string.

In either case, `$V` will be the relevant value, of whatever type from
the input. `$C` will be of type integer, being the number of inputs.

### Mapping to an object/hash

The return value will be of type object/hash, composed of a set of pairs,
expressed within `{}` as:

- a expression of type string
- `:`
- an expression of any type

### Mapping to an array

Within `[]`, the value expression will be an arbitrary value expression.

## Single-value modifiers

A single value can have a modifier, followed by arguments.

### `+`

The operand value must be of type object/hash.
The argument must be a pair of string-value, `:`, any-value.
The return value will be the object/hash with that additional key/value pair.

### `-`

The operand value must be of type object/hash.
The argument must be a string-value.
The return value will be the object/hash without that key.

## Comments

Any `#` character up to the end of that line will be a comment,
and ignored.

# DEBUGGING

To debug, set environment variable `JSON_TRANSFORM_DEBUG` to a true value.

# EXPORT

## parse\_transform

On error, throws an exception. On success, returns a function that can
be called with JSON-able data, that will either throw an exception or
return the transformed data.

Takes arguments:

- $input\_text

    The text describing the transformation.
